Good day, Friend!

I'm Gustavo, a Programming Student willing to achieve my full potential.
I like AI, gaming, technology, everything about it! So, why not learn it?

I started with "Curso em Video", a brazilian youtube channel which do teach a great variety of technologies and things about,
so, I did his HTML/CSS course, but, I stopped... 3 years before, I tried too, but stopped, but this time, I'm not going anywhere
without my dream.

What is my dream, you ask?

Be better than I was yesterday, everyday.

If you're going to follow me, fellow traveler, prepare yourself, we're going to get a headstart!
